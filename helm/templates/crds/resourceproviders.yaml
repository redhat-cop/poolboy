                      This is the same schema specification used by CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs)
                      but with support for additional features supported such as disallowing
                      additional properties of objects. These schemas can be used to place limits
                      on resource definitions beyond the definition of the cluster API such as to
                      restrict a string field to a particular set of allowed values or numeric
                      fields to specific numeric ranges.
